To-do:
Update an existing note*
- re-use NoteEditor with an existing note

Considerations:
- I could use vue-router to have 2 pages:
-- Note list page
-- Edit a note Page
- NoteList could be refactored into a dumb component

Save notes to LocalStorage

Extra:
Search among notes
Pin a note

Done:
Show all notes
Create new notes
Delete a note
